## About this repo
This repository is made for the purpose of archiving the original, private project repository at the time of the final submission, for the purpose of showcasing.

## About the project
This project was made for the Realtime Rendering course at TU Wien. The task was to create a rendering demo with a number of rendering techniques. The demo was required to run above 60 FPS on a NVIDIA GTX 1060 GPU.

The implementation was done from scratch in Vulkan with a few minor libraries for convenience. A full report including the list of implemented effects, libraries used and a instructions for the demo application can be found here: [RealTimeRenderingDocsFinal.pdf](https://github.com/ldkuba/rtr23-luthadel-submission/files/14167117/RealTimeRenderingDocsFinal.pdf)
